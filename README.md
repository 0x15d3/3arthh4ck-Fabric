3arthh4ck is an open source Minecraft 1.12.2 and 1.20 utility mod for anarchy PvP. To install the client, just drop the jar file into your Fabric `.minecraft/mods` folder.

By default, any message prefixed with a `+` will be handled as command, e.g. `+bind clickgui RShift`
to set the default gui key to the Right Shift. 

Because of bloat, some of the more complicated Settings are hidden by default. You can find those by using the Settings module.

# ⚠️ WARNING: The client is not complete. Many modules don't work or crash the client! ⚠️

This is different from [Phobot](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/phobot) and the new [PingBypass](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/pingbypass) system from 3arthqu4ke

### Pingbypass
The pingbypass system is not implemented yet
